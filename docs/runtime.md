# ModelDev Runtime Contract

- Status: service-owned CPU-P01 runtime contract
- Scope: runtime shell inherited from LAYOUT-0 and its ModelDev readiness policy

The service retains the application mechanics inherited from LAYOUT-0. CPU-P01
explicitly changes the template's process-only readiness rule: a listening
ModelDev process must not claim that its unassembled business capabilities are
ready. The service owns this source and runtime contract independently of the
layout.

## Process topology

One Kratos application owns two listeners:

| Listener | Purpose | Default local bind | Public business API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gRPC | service APIs plus standard gRPC health | `127.0.0.1:19090` | contracts exist; business handlers are not assembled yet |
| admin HTTP | process health, readiness, and metrics | `127.0.0.1:19091` | no |

The committed defaults are safe for local execution. A service deployment may
override an address to an unspecified IP such as `0.0.0.0`; that choice belongs
to the service deployment, not to the template default.

## Configuration

- configuration is typed from `internal/conf/v1/conf.proto`;
- the process reads a configuration file selected by `-conf`;
- environment overrides use the `ANI` prefix;
- server configuration contains gRPC, admin HTTP, request timeout, and graceful
  shutdown timeout only;
- validation runs before listeners start;
- supported network value is `tcp`;
- listener addresses must use a literal loopback or unspecified IP plus a valid
  non-zero port;
- gRPC and admin must use distinct non-zero ports; and
- timeout values must be positive and bounded by the validation contract.

No database, message broker, cache, identity endpoint, or provider configuration
is present in LAYOUT-0.

## Composition and lifecycle

- `cmd/ani-modeldev-service/main.go` owns process concerns: configuration loading, logger
  construction, signal handling, and process metadata.
- `cmd/ani-modeldev-service/app.go` is the explicit composition root.
- Kratos `App` owns server start and stop.
- graceful shutdown uses the configured timeout and returns a non-zero result
  when startup or shutdown fails.
- `automaxprocs` is integrated into the same structured logger rather than
  writing an unrelated log format.
- Wire and generated DI code are absent.

The layout assumes one Kratos app per process. A service that changes this model
must review global telemetry-provider ownership explicitly.

## Logging and request correlation

The process emits Kratos structured JSON logs with at least service name,
version, instance ID, timestamp, caller, and trace/span identifiers when a span
is active. Sensitive values must be filtered at the logger boundary. The layout
does not define a business audit log.

## Transport middleware

The frozen gRPC middleware order is:

1. recovery;
2. metadata;
3. tracing;
4. logging;
5. metrics; and
6. validation.

Changing the order is a runtime-contract change because it affects whether
panics, request metadata, trace context, validation failures, latency, and status
are observable consistently.

Kratos error and codec handlers remain the transport boundary. gRPC reflection
is disabled by default. The standard gRPC health service is enabled and reports
transport availability; SERVING does not establish business dependency
readiness. Unimplemented business RPCs fail explicitly.

## Administrative endpoints

| Endpoint | Meaning | Must not imply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /healthz` | the process and admin server can answer | downstream dependencies are healthy |
| `GET /readyz` | mandatory ModelDev business dependencies are ready; HTTP 503 while they are unassembled | listener startup alone proves the service can accept executions |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus exposition for registered runtime metrics | telemetry has been scraped or exported |

Administrative handlers use the same Kratos error, codec, and middleware path
rather than an unrelated ad-hoc HTTP stack.

The current composition does not set readiness merely because its listeners
started. It keeps `/readyz` at HTTP 503 with `NOT_READY`, while `/healthz` remains
available for liveness and diagnosis. Readiness stays false during shutdown.
CPU04's real persistent repository and subsequent required business adapters
must contribute actual dependency checks when they are composed. There is no
configuration switch that declares absent capabilities ready.

## Telemetry

- Prometheus exposes process and Kratos transport metrics on the admin listener;
- OpenTelemetry provides trace propagation and an export integration seam;
- the readiness gauge is named `ani_runtime_ready` and remains 0 while the
  composition has no ready business dependencies;
- telemetry initialization and shutdown are owned by the application lifecycle;
  and
- absence of an external collector must not invent successful export evidence.

Local metric exposition can be verified without proving a production scrape,
dashboard, alert, or trace backend.

## Extension seams

A generated service adds its own API, use cases, repositories, providers, and
dependency-specific probes below the explicit composition root. The
`internal/biz`, `internal/data`, and `internal/service` packages are navigation
seams, not permission boundaries and not a mandate to reproduce ANI's historical
Core/Service split.

## Verification boundary

The executable local checks are described in
[runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md). The layout release records
its own acceptance evidence separately; each generated service must record its
own results. Contract text alone is not runtime evidence.
